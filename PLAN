Project Management
==================
Each iteration consists of one or more stories. Stories can be determined when
the iteration is started, or ahead of time.
Stories can be big or small and are broken down into tasks.
Tasks are discrete units of 25 minutes. An iterating top-down approach is used
for development, ie; no premature optimizations. As simple as possible in the
first iteration. 
Keypoints are meant to be places where we think and come up with new stuff for
next iteration. Updating ports can be done here. No two time units can be used
consecutively for planning.

Schedule, optimistic
